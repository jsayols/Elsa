In the context of the post-electoral protests in Venezuela and the documented disproportionate use of force by Venezuelan security forces, we, the undersigned organizations, demand respect for and guarantee of the right to freedom of expression, assembly and peaceful protest. 

We call on the authorities to refrain from criminalizing protest and to comply fully with international standards and norms on the use of force. 

State authorities and public security forces must respect the right to protest, the protection of which is an essential element in democracies and a historical tool for claiming rights. 

It is also a way for citizens to participate in matters of public interest. 

Likewise, authorities must avoid the use of speeches that encourage and incite violence against people exercising their legitimate right to participate in peaceful demonstrations, as well as avoid stigmatization against civil society organizations.
